    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model and organize code in a way that closely mirrors real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which are self-contained units containing both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "The key objectives of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity and Reusability**: OOP promotes the creation of modular and reusable code components (objects). Once you define a class, you can create multiple instances (objects) of that class, making it easy to reuse code and reduce redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: OOP emphasizes the concept of encapsulation, where the data and methods that operate on the data are bundled together within an object. This helps to hide the internal details of an object and expose only what is necessary for its interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to create abstract classes and methods that define a blueprint for objects without specifying their implementation. Abstraction enables programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, promoting a higher level of understanding and code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** OOP supports the concept of inheritance, where one class (called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called the \"superclass\" or \"base class\"). Inheritance allows you to create hierarchical relationships between classes, facilitating code reuse and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** OOP enables polymorphism, which allows different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables more flexible and generalized coding, as the same code can be used for different classes, provided they share a common interface.\n"
